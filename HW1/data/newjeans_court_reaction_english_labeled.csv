1 Given that Hanni has been found to have lied and deliberately manipulated the public narrative does this constitute grounds for deportation under relevant immigration laws
2 Considering the public shaming inflicted by NewJeans NJZ Hanni can a former BELIFT employee pursue legal action for emotional distress and trauma caused by Hanni actions 
3 Can the former BELIft employee use the evidence presented in the court as herhis evidence of Hannis lie",148,2025-03-09T19:24:52Z,1

@Zoe2014tan,"Attorney Ko is it possible that for the law firm if the girls win the injuction it also spells trouble for their business in the sense contract validity becomes null and void and other quiet artist under kakao will break contracts on issue of abuse and loss of trust So in a sense they can subtly throw away the girls and have them lose fight to pay minimum penalties and focus on Min That way the original goal is preserved Ador is a shell girls loyal to Min but contract validity remains strong thus no other artists will try this

@shuro12345,Thank you for this analysis We have not had a clear position explained by a lawyer regarding MHJs position with NJ members But they must have known that this would be one of ADORs arguments The last comment from the girls is for MHJ which sounds like an admission that this is really the real issue and not mistreatment or bad management as they put it in the interview I find it telling that they dont have a single concrete personal example of a disturbing situation in their workplace other than the case of Hanni who has just lost all credibility,9,2025-03-10T10:14:23Z,-1

@Baddiesc7gn,"The ideal outcome in my opinion is  injunction to permanently bench New Jeans for five years  No performing no brand deals NOTHING  Hold them fully responsible for the breach of contract penalty so if any label wants them after that they can pay the penalty  Also any activity in the futurethey must pay their share of the penalty before they can work again in anything to do with entertainment  music modeling acting any endeavor they must pay their debt to ADOR first  
They need to see if their cult leader leader MHJ Will use any of her savings to support them after they stop receiving the nice checks they are enjoying  
Also their parentsguardians  need to learn about passive aggressiveness  The long term outcome is never good     If they were responsible they would send those girls to therapy for de programming 
MHJ is a mind bender  She has those girls believing they cant breathe without her  She cant sing  She cant write music  She is not a producer  She was good with brands  
She ingratiated herself with Bang SiHyuk  She got talented girls from Source Music  Bang practically gave her a label  Loaned her millions of his personal money to invest in ADOR  New Jeans name originated from Mexican girl group Jeans  The look not so original Concept 90s girl group  Before we ever saw a video MHJ was claiming their success like she was the group leader

@0xyGen_2.p0,"Thank you attorney Ko Great analysis as always About NJs members claiming that they want to be with MHJ no matter of the  outcome of the judgement which was probably meant strategical  to influence the court to decide that future cooperation with Ador is no longer possible and rule in favor of their contract termination  that statement is in my opinion at the same time also potentially very contraproductive Firstly because with this statement they indirectly admited that they are active part of tampering and secondly because with this statement they directly admit that nothing they reasoned as cause of their contract terminations with Ador actually stands is true and that in core of their unilateral contracts terminations werent Adors faults real or made up but something else   the desire to be with Min Hee jin  With that also NJs direct support to her tampering 

What is worse NJ members were publicly claiming from November last year that MHJ never had anything to do with their contract termination but now they openly indirectly admit that they lied and that MHJ was probably the ONLY reason why they terminated their contracts And that they were publicly attacking Ador as we could see from presented evidence in court with direct lies or distorted truths and with false testimony in National Assembly to justify contracts termination 

This seems to me as they indirectly comfirmed that Ador was actualy the victim of their and MHJs dirty game behind which was tampering Your thoughts on this

 And I checked two members seem to had tablets in court Im still in shock about how is this possible and why judges didnt punish them for it Of course I have no idea about what is a practice regarding this in Korea however in my country this would be considered as serious breach of court order and as direct disrespect of court and huge minus for these girls arguments in court 

 They also showed disrespect toward Ador CEO in the court room something we already saw in the National Assembly And they again pulled out a tear jerker while in court but completely different picture outside of court This brings memories on how was Hanni laughing in live stream how her tear jerker in National Assembly worked well Impression was that she almost admitted that her tear jerker was staged Will this affect judges anyhow 

And do you think that court can NJ members still consider as reliable witnesses since impression is that they lied in past and that they easy pull out lies and manipulations at any occassion to achieve their goals Even in court crokodile tears How will judges in your opinion approach to these evident manipulations  Court testimonies are given under oath of saying truth Thank you for your answers",16,2025-03-10T00:00:17Z,-1

@meemac4709,If the Court of South Korea would protect the sanctity and autonomy of contract the Court should decide in favor of Ador If the Court favors what is legally right it should not be affected by the dictates of the popularity of the artist as against to the company that gave them the opportunity to grow as artists not to mention that New Jeans are you kids but their parents have already made liars if not swindlers out of these girls by deliberately misleading people posing dramatic  statements to destroy the company Ador which helped them become famous Their CEO would not be able to create New Jeans without the support of Ador and Hybe Of course these girls are young but their parents who signed the contracts in their behalf should take the consequences by allowing if not teaching their daughters to be negligent of their own commitments,37,2025-03-09T21:40:16Z,1

@sandraotto6352,What would happen if MJH is found guilty in the case against her that started all this as NJ is now pretty much saying their termination declaration was because they wanted to stay with her,47,2025-03-09T21:31:57Z,-1

@teresapang8001,The fact they have to stay with MHJ to exist as a group unhealthy They have no confidence of themselves if they need her So young So immature So sad,161,2025-03-09T21:11:11Z,-1
@Gangstasix,Great video Your expert analysis from a lawyers perspective really helps me understand how legal arguments work Thank you,26,2025-03-09T21:08:29Z,1
@875Maknaeline,No matter how NJZ n MHJ legal counsel restructure their arguments if its foundation were based on lies ill intention towards AdorHybe in the premise of stealing the systemtheir debate will collapse eventually Their stan is base on a hallow ground I believe the saying The 1 who cackles is the 1 laying the eggs Too much talk n drama on NJZMHJ side Meaning they probably are the 1s hiding something I only hope that NJZ will just stop n apologize Leave if they want to But face financial accountability above all Start anew if they still have the face to conquer the world with MHJ Just stop the drama,0,2025-03-09T21:05:46Z,-1

@JungkookTaehung,I am surprised that the members completely embraced ex CEO ADOR as 6th member  Does this in fact STRENGTHEN the case for tampering  Also could the members FALSE testimony at the National Assembly be interpretated AS PERJURY  Can she not be prosecuted not to mention WASTING tax payors money for this sham to be brought to the National Assembly when more serious labor violations have occurred in South Korea,293,2025-03-09T20:20:28Z,-1
@Samuel-hu8uk,The ignore them controversy is a serious one because it damaged the reputation of the labels and artists especially illit who are the real victim of bullying and harassment from team bunnies They are still very young and this kind of situation might severely harm their mental health and its kinda heartbreaking because its not even their fault they did nothing but work hard to improve,150,2025-03-09T20:19:53Z,-1

@merphul,"What sejong is doing makes so little sense  theyre presenting a conspiracy theory based on assertion and emotion 

What makes a twisted sense is this might lay a foundation for an MHJ strategy in her lawsuits ADOR has no value without NJ and NJ has no value with MHJ as she is their sole cause of success and 6th member Not true as the funding resources and staff came from Hybe and Source but it has its own twisted logic 

I dont think its a good strategy for MHJ but she seems to have boxed herself in Claiming ADOR has no value without her is at least an argument that pursuing her for damages is trying to recoup something ADOR never had",36,2025-03-09T20:07:37Z,-1

@charzemc,"Yes their new approach is very calculated legally sound tho I dont think so New Jeans actions have spoken very loudly
They should pay the penalty return Adors IP  move on with MHJ
This is the worst mismanaged break up Ive ever witnessed
A contract is a relationship what kind of coward ends a relationship by holding a press conference  not telling the other party first New Jeans has been extremely disrespectful ill mannered  unprofessional through this exhausting saga the more they say the more people look at them their parents  their puppeteer in disgust
An investor would have to be very unwise to invest in this group of malicious mean girls",222,2025-03-09T19:55:46Z,1
@graveyardprincess,A lot of people became doubtful that Ador would win when the injunction expanded to include music activities because NewJeans could argue that since the trust is broken  they refuse to work with Ador they will have no income and therefore it is harming their life as artists But it seems like their lawyers are focused on helping Min hee jins case not NewJeans Im surprised they didnt bring that argument up in court Maybe next hearing,51,2025-03-09T19:53:33Z,-1
@kanohane,Not being greeted was never that seriousIm still confused how tokkis made this some huge scandal Also it was obvious NewJeans were liars early on because their complaints were always vague or petty af,552,2025-03-09T19:51:28Z,-1

1 Given that Hanni has been found to have lied and deliberately manipulated the public narrative does this constitute grounds for deportation under relevant immigration laws
2 Considering the public shaming inflicted by NewJeans NJZ Hanni can a former BELIFT employee pursue legal action for emotional distress and trauma caused by Hanni actions 
3 Can the former BELIft employee use the evidence presented in the court as herhis evidence of Hannis lie",148,2025-03-09T19:24:52Z,1

@nneichan9353,"I have felt for a while now that NJs will be allowed to terminate their contract mostly through their own refusal to continue a professional relationship with ADOR and the claim it will damage them emotionally 

I do think they will pay penalties but that the costs will not be as high as it should be for the termination and impact on the company which honestly isnt at fault 


If one is honest it is clear this is about MHJ and their reliance on her There is a recognizable desperation to return to her and work with her The relationship brings to mind a Svengali type dependence


I am seriously disappointed with the evolution and what looks like embellishment of the facts in the case especially the ignore her incident",40,2025-03-09T18:32:55Z,1
